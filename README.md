`package dig` provides an opinionated way of resolving object dependencies.

For runnable examples, see the [examples directory](examples/).

## Status

BETA. Expect potential API changes.

## Conatiner

`package dig` exposes `type Container` as an object capable of resolving a
directional dependency graph.

To create one:
```go
import "go.uber.org/dig"

func main() {
	c := dig.New()
	// dig container `c` is ready to use!
}
```

Objects in the container are identified by their `reflect.Type` and **everything
is treated as a singleton**, meaning there can be only one object in the graph
of a given type.

For more advanced use cases, consider using a factory pattern. That is,
have one object shared as a singleton, capable of creating many instances
of the same type on demand.

## Provide

The `Provide` method adds an object, or a constructor of an object, to the container.

There are several ways to `Provide` an object:

1. Provide a constructor function that returns one pointer (or interface)
1. Provide a pointer to an existing object
1. Provide a slice, map, or array

### Provide a Constructor

A constructor is defined as a function that returns one pointer (or
interface), returns an optional error, and takes 0-N number of arguments.

Each one of the arguments is automatically registered as a **dependency**
and must also be an interface or a pointer.

```go
type Type1 struct {}
type Type2 struct {}
type Type3 struct {}

c := dig.New()
err := c.Provide(func(*Type1, *Type2) *Type3 {
	// operate on Type1 and Type2 to make Type3 and return
})
// dig container is now able to provide *Type3 to any constructor.
// However, note that in the current examples *Type1 and *Type2
// have not been provided. Constructors (or instances) first
// have to be provided to the dig container before it is able
// to create a shared singleton instance of *Type3
```

### Provide an object

As a shortcut for objects without dependencies, register it directly.

```go
type Type1 struct {
	Name string
}

c := dig.New()
err := c.Provide(&Type1{Name: "I am a thing"})
// dig container is now able to provide *Type1 as a dependency
// to other constructors that require it.
```

### Provide slices, maps, and arrays

With `dig`, you can also use slices, maps, and arrays as objects
to resolve, or you can `Provide` them as dependencies to the constructor.

```go
c := dig.New()
var (
	typemap = map[string]int{}
	typeslice = []int{1, 2, 3}
	typearray = [2]string{"one", "two"}
)
err := c.Provide(typemap, typeslice, typearray)

var resolveslice []int
err := c.Resolve(&resolveslice)

c.Invoke(func(map map[string]int, slice []int, array [2]string) {
	// do something
})
```

## Resolve

`Resolve` retrieves objects from the container by building the object graph.

Object is resolution is based on the type of the variable passed into `Resolve`
function.

For example, in the current scenario:

```go
// c := dig.New()
// c.Provide...
var cfg config.Provider
c.Resolve(&cfg) // note pointer to interface
```

`dig` looks through the dependency graph and identifies whether a constructor was
registered that is able to return a type of `config.Provider`. It then checks
if said constructor requires any dependencies (by analyzing the function parameters).
If it does, `dig` recursively completes resolutions of the parameters in the graph
until the constructor for `config.Provider` can be fully satisfied.

If resolution is not possible (for instance, if one of the required dependencies
lacks a constructor and doesn't appear in the graph), `dig` returns an error.

## Invoke

The `Invoke` API executes the provided function and stores returned results in the `dig` container.

`Invoke` looks through the dig graph and resolves all the constructor parameters for execution.
Once the method is invoked, `Invoke` inserts returned results, except the `error` object, into the
graph for further use.
To use `Invoke`, make sure your function meets the following criteria:

1. Arguments must be pointers, maps, slices, or arrays
2. Arguments must be provided to dig
3. (Optional) Function has return parameters

For example, `Invoke` scenarios:

How `Invoke` works with an anonymous function:
```go
 // c := dig.New()
// c.Provide... config.Provider, zap.Logger, etc
err := c.Invoke(func(cfg *config.Provider, l *zap.Logger) error {
  // function body
	return nil
})
```

How `Invoke` recursively resolves all the dependencies:
```go
type Foo struct{}

func invokeMe(cfg *config.Provider, l *zap.Logger) (*Foo, error) {
  // function body
	return &Foo{}, nil
}

// c := dig.New()
// c.Provide... config.Provider, zap.Logger, etc
err := c.Invoke(invokeMe)
err := c.Invoke(func(foo *Foo) error {
	// foo is resolved from previous invokeMe call
	return nil
})
//
```
